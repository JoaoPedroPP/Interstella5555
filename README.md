## Project

Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem is a movie picture released in 2003 which the soundtrack is the album Discovery from Daft Punk, released in 2001. The picture is a collaboration between the french duo and Leiji Matsumoto.

The official music video for each track of the album are parts of the picture, and they are easily find on [YouTube](https://youtube.com). In the official Youtube Channel of Daft Punk there is a playlist with Discovery Album ([playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?app=desktop&list=PLSdoVPM5WnndLX6Ngmb8wktMF61dJirKl)).

Thei idea of the project was to promote to the fan a website where they can enjoy Daft Punk work on Interstella 5555 and Discovery album. The site is a page where the user can choose how they want to watch videos, in sequence or random order.

Visit the project on: [bit.ly/discovery-interstella5555](https://bit.ly/discovery-interstella5555), make your choice and enjoy an audio and video experience by Daft Punk :)
